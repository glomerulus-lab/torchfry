besides kernel methods, random feature layers (cite Deep fried convnet paper)
test results not needed
subclass hadamard matmul from nn.module
module naming issues - torchfry
networks submodule:
- explain which are for MNIST vs CIFAR10 datasets
- give the architecture, e.g `Conv-BN-Conv-BN-FC-FC-FC`
transforms submodule:
- beef up hadamard options documentation
- clarify that nonlinearity is for kernel methods
- in notes make clear that the function computes Vx or cos(Vx + u) 
- change epochs to 10 and show output
- maybe another sentence explaining matmul version
- pytorch: divide-and-conquer, explain where this came from
RKSLayer
- say this is just a linear layer if no nonlinearity and matched scale to FastFood layer
- add nonlinearity to parameters docs
- same deal, print output in example
